# Chat-bot-LLama2
# Overview
Welcome to the Chat Bot Llam2 repository! This repository contains the code for a powerful and versatile chat bot built on the Llam2 framework. The chat bot leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to provide an engaging conversational experience.

# Getting Started
To run the code in this repository, follow the steps below:

1.  Open the provided Google Colab notebook (Chat_Bot_Llam2.ipynb).
2.  Ensure that the notebook is running on a GPU-enabled environment. You can enable a GPU by navigating to the "Runtime" menu, selecting "Change runtime type," and then choosing "GPU" under the "Hardware accelerator" section.
3.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially. The code is designed to run seamlessly on a GPU, enhancing performance and responsiveness.
    Dependencies
# This code relies on the following libraries:

TensorFlow
NumPy
NLTK
Other standard Python libraries
Ensure that these dependencies are installed in your Colab environment before running the notebook.

# Note
It is recommended to use Google Colab with a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for optimal performance. You can enable TPU support by going to the "Runtime" menu, selecting "Change runtime type," and then choosing "TPU" under the "Hardware accelerator" section. However, the code is designed to work with GPU as well.

Thank you for using the Chat Bot Llam2! We hope you enjoy the conversational capabilities and find the codebase informative and easy to use.
